# Tic Tac Toe
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/PlaustralCL/tic_tac_toe)](https://repl.it/github/PlaustralCL/tic_tac_toe)
## Description
This is a simple terminal tic tac toe game. It was done as part of
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/tic-tac-toe). You can see a live version on [Replit.com](https://replit.com/@PlaustralCL/tictactoe#README.md). If it has not run in a while it may take a few seconds to load.

## Reflections
* This was the first Ruby project to use objects and my first time trying to
use object oriented programming (OOP)
* Based on other examples that I had seen, having the 'X's and 'O's the same
color as the numbers made it difficult to read, so I found a way to add color
* I also felt that having a new board printed in the terminal made it more
difficult to keep track of the game. I was able to find a way to refresh/ clear
the terminal to keep the board in place.
